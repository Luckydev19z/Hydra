## Extension Points

### 1. Model Providers
Implement a new AI/ML provider using the Model interface:
```go
type ModelProvider interface {
    Predict(context.Context, PredictionRequest) (PredictionResponse, error)
    Train(context.Context, TrainingData) (ModelMetadata, error)
}
```

### 2. Plugins
Add custom behaviors through the Plugin interface:
```go
type Plugin interface {
    GetID() string
    Execute(state *State) error
    Context(state *State) ([]StateData, error)
}
```

## Using Hydra Codex as a Module
1. Install the package:
```bash
npm install @hydra/codex
```
2. Import and use in your project:
```typescript
import { Engine, ModelClient, MemoryManager } from '@hydra/codex';
const modelClient = new ModelClient({
  provider: 'tensorflow',
  modelPath: process.env.TENSORFLOW_MODEL_PATH,
});
const engine = new Engine({ model: modelClient });
const response = await engine.process("Hello, Hydra Codex");
```
